### Creates tiles in which each pixel is a combination of the continent and FAO FRA 2000 ecozone.
### The tiles are based on a shapefile which combines the FAO FRA 2000 ecozone shapefile and a continent shapefile.
### The FAO FRA 2000 shapefile is from http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get?id=1255&fname=eco_zone.zip&access=private
### The continent shapefile is from https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/ESRI+International+Data
### Various processing steps in ArcMap were used to make sure that the entirety of the ecozone shapefile had
### continents assigned to it. The creation of the continent-ecozone shapefile was done in ArcMap.
### In the resulting ecozone-continent shapefile, the final field has continent and ecozone concatenated.
### That ecozone-continent field can be parsed to get the ecozone and continent for every pixel,
### which are necessary for assigning removals rates to pixels.
### This script also breaks the input tiles into windows that are 1024 pixels on each side and assigns all pixels that
### don't have a continent-ecozone code to the most common code in that window.
### This is done to expand the extent of the continent-ecozone tiles to include pixels that don't have a continent-ecozone
### code because they are just outside the original shapefile.
### It is necessary to expand the continent-ecozone codes into those nearby areas because otherwise some forest age category
### pixels are outside the continent-ecozone pixels and can't have removals rates assigned to them.
### This maneuver provides the necessary continent-ecozone information to assign removals rates.
